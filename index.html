                                The first laboratory-confirmed case in the US was on January 15, 2020 in Washington state: an elderly woman returning from Wuhan, China. Since that point, the virus has rapidly expanded through every state in the United States. In March of 2020, many states began enacting shelter in place orders to help contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, with the intention being to "flatten the curve" and avoid overwhelming healthcare services (like hospitals, clinics, ICU beds, etc.) At first, the spread was most severe in the most populated areas: New York City, notably, was hit particularly hard. Soon, other populous states such as Illinois and California saw their own explosion of cases.

                            <h2>

                            <p>
                                The world has no shortage of examples of nations that handled the pandemic in a manner than minimized harm to its citizens: South Korea being the shining example of employing contact tracing and widespread mask adoption. Some states in the US were quite aggressive in their shutdown protocols, and exemplify the notion of flattening the curve. Our first example is Vermont, which despite neighboring New York state, had a strong compliance rate with both stay at home orders and mask adoption. The graph below shows how the number of confirmed cases is growing slowly, with only around 700 new confirmed cases between April 12 and July 30. The death count of Vermont as of August 1st is 57, which is miniscule when compared to New York state's over 32,000 deaths to date. This response allowed Vermont to reopen with comparatively minimal impact to overall case numbers.

                            <p>

                                What went wrong?

                            <p>
                                The response to the virus was politicized, which reduced the effictiveness of any possible response. The governors of each state had to race to develop their own responses, since by April, it became clear that federal aid was not coming.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Some states responded poorly compared to others. One example is the case of Florida, which ended its stay at home order on April 30, 2020. As of May 4th, many businesses reopened to some degree, with full reopening finished by June 1st. The result in the number of cases is clear, especially skyrocketing on such holidays as Memorial day (May 25th) and the 4th of July, which resulted in massive gatherings of people. The overall rate of using masks was, and still is, one of the lowest, leading to exponential growth that is continuing as of August 1st, 2020. As a late response to the growing number of cases, Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered bars to begin closing on June 26th, which did little to stop the upcoming spread.

                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                Other states fell somewhere in between these two extremes. Some states that might be interesting to explore are ones that are isolated, with extremely small populations (Alaska, Hawaii). Another interesting category would be seeing how political affinity affected large population states (e.g., California vs. Texas).

You can also choose to hide or show any graphs. The chart is set to Illinois, which had a strong response from the governor (but a large population, which made the spread of the virus hard to contain).

                    Many states varied widely in their responses to COVID-19. In this Narrative Visualization, we will look at a few different extreme examples of states' responses, describe the situation that occurred behind the scenes of the data, and compare and contrast the different results they produced. At the end you're going to be able to explore other states to see what they did right and wrong and make some conclusions for yourself. Got it? Let's go!
